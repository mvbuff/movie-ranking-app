# Forum Delete Functionality

## Overview
Added comprehensive delete functionality for both forum threads and posts with proper permission controls.

## Features Implemented

### 🗑️ **Thread Deletion**
- **User Permission**: Users can delete their own threads
- **Admin Permission**: Admins can delete any thread
- **Cascade Delete**: Deleting a thread automatically deletes all its posts (database-level cascade)
- **Confirmation**: Requires confirmation before deletion
- **UI Locations**: 
  - Delete button (🗑️) on thread list in forum page
  - "🗑️ Delete Thread" button on individual thread pages

### 🗑️ **Post Deletion**
- **User Permission**: Users can delete their own posts
- **Admin Permission**: Admins can delete any post
- **Protection**: First post of a thread CANNOT be deleted (prevents thread structure breaking)
- **Cascade Delete**: Deleting a post automatically deletes all its replies (database-level cascade)
- **Confirmation**: Requires confirmation before deletion
- **UI Location**: Delete button (🗑️) on each post in thread view

## Permission System

### **For Regular Users:**
- ✅ Can delete their own threads
- ✅ Can delete their own posts (except first post of thread)
- ❌ Cannot delete other users' content

### **For Admins:**
- ✅ Can delete any thread
- ✅ Can delete any post (except first posts)
- ✅ Special tooltip indicates "(Admin)" when deleting others' content
- ✅ All regular user permissions

## API Endpoints

### **DELETE /api/forum/threads**
```typescript
// Request body
{
  threadId: string,
  userId: string
}

// Responses
200: { message: 'Thread deleted successfully' }
401: { error: 'Authentication required' }
403: { error: 'You can only delete your own threads unless you are an admin' }
404: { error: 'Thread not found' }
```

### **DELETE /api/forum/posts**
```typescript
// Request body
{
  postId: string,
  userId: string
}

// Responses
200: { message: 'Post deleted successfully' }
400: { error: 'Cannot delete the first post of a thread. Delete the entire thread instead.' }
401: { error: 'Authentication required' }
403: { error: 'You can only delete your own posts unless you are an admin' }
404: { error: 'Post not found' }
```

## UI/UX Features

### **Visual Indicators**
- 🗑️ Red trash icon for delete buttons
- Loading spinner during deletion process
- Disabled state while deleting
- Tooltips showing delete permissions

### **User Experience**
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
- Success/error toast notifications
- Automatic UI refresh after deletion
- Thread deletion redirects back to forum

### **Responsive Design**
- Delete buttons positioned appropriately
- Mobile-friendly button sizes
- Consistent styling with app theme

## Security Features

### **Authentication Checks**
- All delete operations require valid session
- User ID verification from request body
- Permission checks against database records

### **Authorization Logic**
```typescript
const isAuthor = content.author.id === userId;
const isAdmin = currentUser.role === 'ADMIN';

if (!isAuthor && !isAdmin) {
  return 403; // Forbidden
}
```

### **Data Integrity**
- Prevents deletion of first posts (would break thread structure)
- Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
- Transaction-based operations ensure consistency

## Error Handling

### **Client-Side**
- Network error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states prevent double-clicks
- Form validation before API calls

### **Server-Side**
- Comprehensive error logging
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Testing Scenarios

### **As a Regular User:**
1. ✅ Delete your own thread → Success
2. ✅ Delete your own post → Success
3. ❌ Try to delete another user's thread → Permission denied
4. ❌ Try to delete first post of thread → Not allowed
5. ❌ Try to delete without authentication → Unauthorized

### **As an Admin:**
1. ✅ Delete any user's thread → Success (marked as Admin action)
2. ✅ Delete any user's post → Success (marked as Admin action)
3. ❌ Try to delete first post → Not allowed (same rule applies)

## Database Impact

### **Cascade Behavior**
- Thread deletion → All posts in thread deleted
- Post deletion → All replies to that post deleted
- User deletion → All their threads/posts deleted (existing schema)

### **Performance**
- Efficient single-query deletions
- Database handles cascading automatically
- No orphaned records created

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Features**
- Soft delete (mark as deleted instead of removing)
- Delete reason/audit log
- Bulk delete operations for admins
- Restore deleted content functionality
- Delete notifications to affected users

### **Admin Tools**
- Moderation dashboard
- Bulk content management
- User content overview
- Delete statistics

The delete functionality is now fully implemented and ready for use! Users can manage their own content while admins have full moderation capabilities.
